title: Acquiring API Credentials
---

Our team uses API method to integrate DiamanteDesk plugins or modules with different content management systems. API stands for Application programming interface, so it is a software-to-software interface that enables different programs to connect and share information between each other.

DiamanteDesk API integration serves to create individual customer support systems to all sorts of web portals, on-line stores and blogs. Currently, DiamanteDesk is integrated with [Magento](magento.html), [WordPress](wordpress.html) and [PrestaShop](prestashop.html) content management systems.

To connect a content management system and the Client's CRM, API credentials shall be provided.
