DiamanteDesk is an independent help desk system that currently can be easily integrated into the open-source OroCRM and is going to be available for other CRMs in the near future.  Therefore, DiamanteDesk can be installed as a standalone application or as a help desk extension to the OroCRM. 

When installed on the basis of the OroCRM, DiamanteDesk functionality is available at the **Desk** top menu.

This menu provides fast and easy access to the general functionality and data of the DiamanteDesk application, specifically:

* [Branches](../user-guide/branches.md)
* [Tickets](../user-guide/tickets.md)
* Reports

## Tickets in OroCRM

When DiamanteDesk is installed on the basis of the OroCRM, administrators can view the tickets submitted to the system in the following sections:

* _Desk > Branches_. Tickets in the DiamanteDesk are grouped into the **Branches**. Creating separate branches enables our Clients to group tickets according to the requests of specific users, locations, issues or according to the [Channel](../user-guide/channels/index.md) the ticket came from.

* _Desk > All Tickets_. Tickets can be accessed directly at the **Tickets** section. They are not grouped according to any category on this screen an can be filtered according to the ticket **Key**, **Subject**, **Branch**, **Assignee**, **Priority**, **Status**, or time period when it was **Created** or **Updated**

* _Customers > Accounts_. Account records referred to as **Accounts** in OroCRM are created to collect and analyze the information on customer activity of a person or group of people belonging to a certain company or organization. Administrators can view all the tickets created or updated by the users belonging to this account at the read-only **Support Tickets** grid in the **Additional Information** section. It displays general ticket information, such as ticket **Key**, **Subject**, **Status**, **Reporter** and date and time when it was updated.

* _Customers > Contacts_. The **Customers** screen contains information about all the customers who created tickets at the [DiamanteDesk portal](../user-guide/channels/portal.md). Administrators can view all the tickets created or updated by the certain customer at the read-only **Support Tickets** grid in the **Additional Information** section. It displays general ticket information, such as ticket **Key**, **Subject**, **Status** and date and time when it was created.
