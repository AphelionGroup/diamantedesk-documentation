#Web Portal

DiamanteDesk is designed to organize all incoming customer requests from all sources in a single place to ensure quick reply and reasonable solution to a problem, if any.

Every service user has 3 available options to contact the Help Desk team:

* by creating a request through a **web form**;
* as an **email notification**;
* via a **phone call**.

When a customer attempts to leave a request or report an issue through a web portal, the system redirects this user to a DiamanteDesk request module. A user should register or provide log in details in order to create a ticket.
