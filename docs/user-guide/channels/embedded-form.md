#Embedded Form

DiamanteDesk is a simple tool designed to improve user experience for each of your present and future customers. 
Ð¡ustomers are mostly happy when your service meets their expectations, is easy-to-use and does not distract them from the main task it was made for. But in complex systems something may always go wrong and a user should have various options to contact your help desk team and let them know what should be fixed or changed. DiamanteDesk system offers 4 options to do that.

Some of our Clients prefer to embed a ticketing form into their website.
