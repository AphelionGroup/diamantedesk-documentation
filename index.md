**Helps listening to your customers.**

DiamanteDesk is an independent support ticket system which is designed to _listen_ to your customers and quickly _react_ to satisfy their needs. Currently, it can be easily integrated into the Oro platform but in the short run it will be available for other CRM systems.

Our software enables big and small companies to support and guide their customers through [emails](user-guide/channels/email-processing.html), [websites](user-guide/channels/portal.html) and phone calls. It is an easy and user-friendly tool designed to create tickets within the CRM and associate them with any customer from the system. 

In DiamanteDesk tickets can be assigned to specific users and administrators and grouped into [Branches](user-guide/branches.html) in order to organize the workflow and focus on high-priority issues and requests.
