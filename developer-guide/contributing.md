The DiamanteDesk development team accepts contributions to code and documentation from the community. If you have found a bug, don't hesitate to let us know about it! We do our best to make DiamanteDesk as easy-to-use and as helpful as possible, so we are thankful for any effort to enhance application's functionality.

## Contributing Code

When creating DiamanteDesk application and for other projects we work on, we prefer to stick to certain PHP coding standards, described in [PSR-0](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-0/), [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/), [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) and [PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) documentation. This strategy ensures structure quality and easier software maintenance. Therefore, when contributing to DiamanteDesk, please make sure to follow these coding standards.

Any contribution can be made as an **Issue** or **Pull Request** in the corresponding section of the [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/eltrino).

DiamanteDesk functionality is separated into the **bundles**, such as ApiBindle, FrontBundle, EmbeddedFormBundle, EmailProcessingBundle, etc. When contributing to code or reporting an issue, please select the bundle responsible for specific functionality.

## Contributing Documentation

DiamanteDesk documentation uses [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) syntax and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for generating the documentation in the HTML format.

The application documentation, as well as its code, is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/eltrino/diamantedesk-documentation). You need a GitHub user account to contribute to the documentation.

When editing or contributing to documentation, you can either create an **Issue** on GitHub, describe it and let us know what exactly shall be changed, or you can make changes independently in the same way, described in the **Code Changes** section.
