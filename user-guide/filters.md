Filters in DiamanteDesk are a great tool helping you to quickly find any records, tickets and users you are searching for within the system. Every data grid can be filtered according to each grid parameter. You can learn more about filtering parameters of every data grid in the corresponding section of the user guide:

* [Branches](branches.html);
* [Tickets](tickets.html);
* [Customers](customers.html);
* [Users](users.html).

Generally, the filter bar is located above the grid as shown in the picture below:
