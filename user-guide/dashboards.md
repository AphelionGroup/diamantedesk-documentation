Dashboard in DiamanteDesk is a progress control panel providing a quick access to the most valuable and constantly changing data of the support system. All the data required for analysis is added to dashboards in widgets. If needed, several dashboards may be created for different purposes to provide better organization and data clarity.

## Add Dashboard

To add a new dashboard:

1. Click the dashboard top menu at the left corner of the screen.

Field | Description
------------- | -------------
Label  | Provide the name for this dashboard. If there are several dashboards in the system, make sure that dashboard name clearly describes its purpose.
Clone from  | This option allows copying one of the existing dashboards. For example, when several departments or administrators need separate dashboards where most widgets are similar but several other ones should be different, there is no need to create each widget from scratch. Click the down arrow and select the existing dashboard that shall be cloned. To create a new dashboard from scratch select **Blank Dashboard**. 
Owner | By default, this field is populated with the account of the administrator currently logged in the system. Click the **List** button to change a dashboard owner. An owner can manage the dashboard according to the needs of administrators. 

Click **Save** or **Save and Close** at the top right corner of the screen for the corresponding action. After the dashboard is saved, it becomes available at the dashboard top menu. If it is cloned from some existing dashboard, it contains the same widgets as the original one; if it is created from scratch, it is empty (as shown in the example below).
