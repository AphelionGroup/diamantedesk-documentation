Field | Description
------------- | -------------
Label  | Provide the name for this dashboard. If there are several dashboards in the system, make sure that dashboard name clearly describes its purpose.
Clone from  | This option allows copying one of the existing dashboards. For example, when several departments or administrators need separate dashboards where most widgets are similar but several other ones should be different, there is no need to create each widget from scratch. Click the down arrow and select the existing dashboard that shall be cloned. To create a new dashboard from scratch select **Blank Dashboard**. 
Owner | By default, this field is populated with the account of the administrator currently logged in the system. Click the **List** button to change a dashboard owner. An owner can manage the dashboard according to the needs of administrators. 

Click **Save** or **Save and Close** at the top right corner of the screen for the corresponding action. After the dashboard is saved, it becomes available by clicking the **Dashboards** icon at the top left corner of the screen. If it is cloned from another dashboard, it is going to contain the same widgets as the original one; if it is created from scratch, it is going to be empty (as shown in the example below).
