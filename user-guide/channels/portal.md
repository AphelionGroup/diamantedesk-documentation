When a customer attempts to leave a request through a web site supported by DiamanteDesk, the system redirects the user to a request module at http://example.com/web/app.php/portal/. In order to create a ticket the user should either log in or register in case it is a first request.

* **Date** field displays the date when the request has been created.
* **Subject** is a short summary of an issue occurred.
* **Priority** field displays the selected priority of the created ticket (Low, Medium or High).
