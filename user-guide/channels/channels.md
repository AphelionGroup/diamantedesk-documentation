#Channels

DiamanteDesk is a customer support system which functions either as a standalone application, extends CRM functionality or can be integrated with a number of content management systems.

This software is designed to organize all incoming customer requests from all sources in a single place to ensure quick reply and reasonable solution to a problem, if any.

Every user of a service supported by the DiamanteDesk system will have 4 available channels to contact the Help Desk team:

* by creating a request through a **web portal**;
* via **embedded forms** on websites, online stores, blogs, etc.;
* by sending an **email notification**;
* or via a **phone call**.

Currently, first three options are available. Follow the links to learn more about submitting a request through a [**web portal**](portal.md), [**embedded forms**](embedded-form.md) or about [**email processing**](email-processing.md) feature.
