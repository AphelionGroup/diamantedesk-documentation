<h2 id="contributing-code">Contributing Code</h2>

<p>When creating DiamanteDesk application and for other projects we work on, we prefer to stick to certain PHP coding standards, described in <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-0/">PSR-0</a>, <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/">PSR-1</a>, <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/">PSR-2</a> and <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/">PSR-4</a> documentation. This strategy ensures structure quality and easier software maintenance. Therefore, when contributing to DiamanteDesk, please make sure to follow these coding standards.</p>

<p>Any contribution can be made as an <strong>Issue</strong> or <strong>Pull Request</strong> in the corresponding section of the <a href="https://github.com/eltrino">repository on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>DiamanteDesk functionality is separated into the <strong>bundles</strong>, such as ApiBindle, FrontBundle, EmbeddedFormBundle, EmailProcessingBundle, etc. When contributing to code or reporting an issue, please select the bundle responsible for specific functionality.</p>
