<p>When a customer of any web service supported by the DiamanteDesk needs to report an issue or submit a request to the help desk team, a <em>ticket</em> is created. Each ticket in DiamanteDesk application has a unique identificator and is sorted according to the <em>branch</em> where it is created or is added to a default branch.</p>

<p>Creating separate branches in DiamanteDesk enables our Clients to group tickets according to the requests of specific users, locations, issues or according to the <a href="channels/index.html">Channel</a> the ticket came from. This feature helps to organize tickets in a way to keep track of the tickets according to a certain category and quickly find them in a system. We remember that good customer service implies quick reaction and problem solving, so we do our best to provide our Clients with a user-friendly tool to make it work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Note:</em> When the ticket is automatically created from the email received at the the support email address, this ticket is created at the branch which is configured as a default one. To learn more about it, please see the <a href="channels/email-processing.html">Email Processing</a> section.</p>

<h2 id="branch-filters">Branch Filters</h2>

<p>All branches can be filtered according to the <strong>Branch Name</strong> or <strong>Branch Key</strong>.</p>

<p>Branch key is automatically generated from the branch name when a new branch is created and it should be unique across the system. Branch key must contain only letters. Minimum length is 2 letters. If Branch name consists of more than one word, the system takes the first character of every word and converts them to upper case (for example, Green Daisy - GD, Diamante Desk - DD, etc.). If branch name consists of a single word, branch key is generated from the first 2-4 characters in the upper case (for example, Eltrino - ELTR, bbq - BBQ, etc.).</p>

<p><strong>Branch name</strong> and <strong>Branch Key</strong> filters are set to <strong>All</strong> values by default. To filter the branches according to a certain branch name or key, click the down arrow in the corresponding filed and enter the required name or key. To refresh the results, click <strong>Refresh</strong>. To clear all filters, click <strong>Reset</strong>.</p>
