<p>Every time a customer or administrator performs any action in the system, this action is added to the read-only event-action history log. Actions are entity properties that are created, updated or removed. Entities are users, branches, tickets, comments, attachments. Examples of actions stored in the action history log:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A new user was created in the system</li>
  <li>A new comment was added</li>
  <li>An existing ticket was updated</li>
  <li>A branch was deleted</li>
</ul>

<p>To view all the actions made by the users in the system, move to <em>System &gt; Data Audit</em>. The <strong>Data Audit</strong> screen opens. This screen contains the following information regarding the actions performed:</p>
