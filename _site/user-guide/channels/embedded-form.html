<p>DiamanteDesk is a help desk designed to improve user experience for each of your present and future customers.</p>

<p>In complex systems something may always go wrong and any user should always have various options to contact your support team and let them know what should be fixed or changed. DiamanteDesk system offers several options to do that: by sending an <a href="email-processing.html">email</a>, via a phone call or through a <a href="portal.html">web portal</a>. Some of our Clients also prefer to embed a support form into their website.</p>

<p>DiamanteDesk provides functionality for creating embedded forms on the third-party websites. Take a look at the picture below to see the initial form. It can be modified according to the design of your website.</p>

<p>This form includes the fields for acquisition of user <strong>First Name</strong> and <strong>Last Name</strong>, <strong>Email</strong>  that is going to be used to inform a user on the status of a ticket creation and processing, the <strong>Subject</strong> field for a short precise description of a request or an issue, the <strong>Description</strong> field to specify a reason to contact the support team in details and attachment field allowing to add screenshots in case there are any UI issues.</p>

<p>After a user clicks the <strong>Submit</strong> button, the message from the embedded form is automatically converted into a ticket in a specific branch.</p>
