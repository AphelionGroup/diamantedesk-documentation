<p>DiamanteDesk may serve as an independent end-user application or as an extension for OroCRM. In the nearest future it will also be available for other CRMs.</p>

<p>This section provides detailed instructions on various options of DiamanteDesk application installation.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>DiamanteDesk application was built using <strong>Symfony</strong> 2.3 framework and <strong>Oro</strong> Platform; therefore, all the prerequisites listed as <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/2.3/reference/requirements.html">Symfony</a> and <a href="http://www.orocrm.com/documentation/index/current/system-requirements">Oro</a> system requirements also refer to DiamanteDesk.</p>

<p>In addition, here is a list of requirements related specifically to the DiamanteDesk application:</p>

<ul>
  <li>app/attachments folder needs to be writable;</li>
  <li>NPM package manager needs to be installed;</li>
  <li>Grunt needs to be installed (globally);</li>
  <li>Bower needs to be installed (globally).</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>You can also check whether your system meets all the requirements from the command line. In order to do that, after you get the application code, execute the following command:</p>

<pre><code>php app/check.php
</code></pre>

<p>To install DiamanteDesk you also need to setup MySQL database server with an empty database that will be used later on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Note:</em> DiamanteDesk application makes heavy use of HTTP methods in RESTful calls. The server can be configured to block some of them (for example, PUT, DELETE, etc.). However, this limitation should be removed, otherwise, a certain part of application will not function properly.</p>
