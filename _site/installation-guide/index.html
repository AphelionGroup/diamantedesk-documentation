<p>DiamanteDesk may serve as an independent end-user application or as an extension for OroCRM. In the nearest future it will also be available for other CRMs.</p>

<p>This section provides detailed instructions on various options of DiamanteDesk application installation.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>DiamanteDesk application was built using <strong>Symfony</strong> 2.3 framework and <strong>Oro</strong> Platform; therefore, all the prerequisites listed as <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/2.3/reference/requirements.html">Symfony</a> and <a href="http://www.orocrm.com/documentation/index/current/system-requirements">Oro</a> system requirements also refer to DiamanteDesk.</p>

<p>As for the additional requirements specific for DiamanteDesk, the <strong>app/attachments</strong> folder needs to be writable for the proper operation of the application.</p>

<p>To install DiamanteDesk you also need to setup MySQL database server with an empty database that will be used later on.</p>

<p>Optionally, in case you need to customize your portal, your system shall comply with additional requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>NPM package manager needs to be installed;</li>
  <li>Grunt needs to be installed (globally);</li>
  <li>Bower needs to be installed (globally).</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also check whether your system meets all the requirements from the command line. In order to do that, you should start with getting the <a href="#get-code">application code</a> from Github and required <a href="#libraries">libraries</a>. Then you can run the following command:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">php app/check.php</span></code></pre></div>
