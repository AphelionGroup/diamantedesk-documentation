<p><strong>Helps listening to your customers.</strong></p>

<p>DiamanteDesk is an independent support ticket system which is designed to <em>listen</em> to your customers and quickly <em>react</em> to satisfy their needs. Currently, it can be easily integrated into the Oro platform but in the short run it will be available for other CRM systems.</p>

<p>Our software enables big and small companies to support and guide their customers through <a href="user-guide/channels/email-processing.html">emails</a>, <a href="user-guide/channels/portal.html">websites</a> and phone calls. It is an easy and user-friendly tool designed to create tickets within the CRM and associate them with any customer from the system.</p>

<p>In DiamanteDesk tickets can be assigned to specific users and administrators and grouped into <a href="user-guide/branches.html">Branches</a> in order to organize the workflow and focus on high-priority issues and requests.</p>
